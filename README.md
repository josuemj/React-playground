# 🧪 React Playground

Welcome to **React Playground** – a lab of experiments, components, and pages ranging from the basics to more advanced stuff. This repo is all about learning, breaking things, and rebuilding them better. Whether it's styling, routing, state management, data viz, or pure UI madness – it's all here (or will be soon™).

## 🚀 What is this?

A growing collection of React experiments, including:

- 🧱 Component testing (from buttons to full pages)
- 🎨 Styling playground (CSS, Tailwind, maybe even weird stuff)
- 📈 Data viz trials (graphs, charts, dynamic content)
- 🧠 State and hook practice (the custom hook dark arts)
- ⚗️ General React weirdness, just for science
- 🤖 Possibly some AI/data integration later on

> This repo is expected to grow as React evolves and introduces new features.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- React (obviously)
- React Router
- TypeScript (eventually, if not already)
- CSS/Tailwind
- Recharts or other graph libs (planned)
- Maybe Zustand, Jotai, or other state libs (who knows?)

## Testing
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
```bash
npx playwright test --ui // Launches the Playwright Test Runner UI
npx playwright test // Runs all tests in the terminal
```
